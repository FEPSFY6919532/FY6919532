     Social Engineering is becoming an increasingly greater threat to cyber security because attackers use people to get what they want rather 
     than technical weaknesses. This paper explores how attackers use a variety of methods to manipulate users into giving them confidential
     information or clicking on malicious links.Common methods, such as phishing, smishing, and pretexting, are covered, along with the reasons
     how they exploit human vulnerabilities. These attacks can also have major implications on big organisations, through data breaches or 
     financial loss. Finally, the paper talks about defensive measures that can be taken to prevent such attacks from happening. 
     For example, spreading awareness on the matter, as well as multi-factor authentication. The overall aim of the paper is to highlight the
     threat of social engineering, but also to show that it is possible to prevent attacks if the right measures are in place.

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    Social Engineering is one of the most common ways cyber attackers gain access to systems and confidential information. Rather than trying
    to break the hardware or software, social engineering relies on the manipulating people into revealing information or clicking on 
    dangerous links that give the attacker access to what they want. As communication continues to develop, through email and social media, 
    the opportunities for these attacks have greatly increased. At the same time, many people are still unaware of the dangers and do not
    know how to differentiate a scam and a real email. Attackers exploit these people as it is much easier to fool a person than to
    hack into a system. Human error accounts for 95% of successful cyber attacks, <a href="#Ref1">(Alsharif et al., 2021)</a>. The rest of
    this paper discusses why social engineering is on the rise, the methods attackers use and how they exploit certain human vulnerabilities.
    Also the impacts on large companies, and key strategies that can help to greatly reduce the risks created by social engineering.

  <h3 id="Types of Social Engineering Attacks">Types of Social Engineering Attacks</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    There are many different forms of social engineering attacks, but most rely on the user being manipulated to do something that 
    will benefit the attacker. The 4 main methods are phishing, spear phishing, smishing and pretexting. 
    The most common method of attack is phishing. This is where a large number of fraudelent emails are sent out in an attempt to
    trick people into clicking on harmful links or revealing confidential information. These messages appear to have come from 
    trusted organisations, making them difficult to spot. Much like fishing, the attacker relies on peope taking the "bait".
    Phishing is responsible for approximately 65% of all social engineering attacks in 2025, as per <a href="#Ref2">(Unit 42, 2025)</a>.
    Below is a table showing the number of reported cases of phishing per year. Data per <a href="#Ref3">(Crane, 2024).
