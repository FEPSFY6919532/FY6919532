     Social Engineering is becoming an increasingly greater threat to cyber security because attackers use people to get what they want rather 
     than technical weaknesses. This paper explores how attackers use a variety of methods to manipulate users into giving them confidential
     information or clicking on malicious links.Common methods, such as phishing, smishing, and pretexting, are covered, along with the reasons
     how they exploit human vulnerabilities. These attacks can also have major implications on big organisations, through data breaches or 
     financial loss. Finally, the paper talks about defensive measures that can be taken to prevent such attacks from happening. 
     For example, spreading awareness on the matter, as well as multi-factor authentication. The overall aim of the paper is to highlight the
     threat of social engineering, but also to show that it is possible to prevent attacks if the right measures are in place.

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Introduction_InText">
    Social Engineering is one of the most common ways cyber attackers gain access to systems and confidential information. Rather than trying
    to break the hardware or software, social engineering relies on the manipulating people into revealing information or clicking on 
    dangerous links that give the attacker access to what they want. As communication continues to develop, through email and social media, 
    the opportunities for these attacks have greatly increased. At the same time, many people are still unaware of the dangers and do not
    know how to differentiate a scam and a real email. Attackers exploit these people as it is much easier to fool a person than to
    hack into a system. Human error accounts for 95% of successful cyber attacks, <a href="#Ref1">(Alsharif et al., 2021)</a>. The rest of
    this paper discusses why social engineering is on the rise, the methods attackers use and how they exploit certain human vulnerabilities.
    Also the impacts on large companies, and key strategies that can help to greatly reduce the risks created by social engineering.

  <h3 id="Types of Social Engineering Attacks">Types of Social Engineering Attacks</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre id="TypesofAttack_InText">
    There are many different forms of social engineering attacks, but most rely on the user being manipulated to do something that 
    will benefit the attacker. The 4 main methods are phishing, spear phishing, smishing and pretexting. 
    The most common method of attack is phishing. This is where a large number of fraudelent emails are sent out in an attempt to
    trick people into clicking on harmful links or revealing confidential information. These messages appear to have come from 
    trusted organisations, making them difficult to spot. Much like fishing, the attacker relies on peope taking the "bait".
    Phishing is responsible for approximately 65% of all social engineering attacks in 2025, as per <a href="#Ref2">(Unit 42, 2025)</a>.
    Below is a table showing the number of reported cases of phishing per year. Data per <a href="#Ref3">(Crane, 2024)</a>,
     
   <table>
     <tr>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>Number of reported cases of phishing</th>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>2020</td>
        <td>6,942,158</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>2021</td>
        <td>8,726,021</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>2022</td>
        <td>10,513,657</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>2023</td>
        <td>13,438,810</td>
     </tr>
   </table>
   This shows a year on year increase and shows that there are only going to be more cases in the future unless something is
   done to prevent this.
   A similar method attackers use is spear phishing. These attacks are a more targeted version of phishing as it is aimed
   at specific individuals and companies. The attackers finds information about the target beforehand, which they can 
   use to sound more convincing, therefore giving them a higher chance of success. 

   Another frequently used approach is smishing, which is where attackers send deceptive text messages to the users
   mobile phones. These are often disguised as warnings from banks or notifying the user of a delivery, prompting them
   to respond quickly. Finally, pretexting is where the attacker creates a believable scenario to obtain information, such
   as pretending to techincal support or being a representative of a well-known company.
   Each of these methods look to exploit human trust in order to gain access to confidential information or computer
   systems without the need to break any hardware or software.

  <h3 id="Impacts on Organisations">Impacts on Organisations</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Impacts_InText">
   Social engineering attacks can target individuals, but companies can also be susceptible to these attacks, and these can have
   serious consequences for these companies. One of the immediate consequences is financial loss, which can occur through
   fraudulent payments or stolen credential. Attackers will exploit employees at a company, sending phishing emails to their
   work email. If successful, this can lead to unauthorised access to company accounts or private information, leading to 
   great financial damage. In 2024, the average financial cost per breach in the UK was £3.58 million <a href="#Ref4">(IBM, 2024)</a>.
   Another major consequence is data breaches. This is where the attackers gain sensitive information, such as login details for 
   customers or company records. The attackers can then use this to do further damage, such as blackmail. This also gets the 
   organisation in legal trouble.
   Another consequence of attacks is damage to the organisations reputation. If people see that a company has been 
   successfully breached, they are much less likely to trust them. This harms the companies public image, which can lead to 
   a financial impact on the company.

  <h3 id="Prevention Strategies">Prevention Strategies</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Prevention_InText">
   Now we will discuss how we can reduce the risk of social engineering attacks by implementing prevention strategies.
   One such prevention stategy is user training on a regular basis at companies. This will help employees or even the general public
   to identify fraudulent emails and understand different techniques attackers can use, which will allow them to report any suspicious
   activity.
   Another measure that can be implemented is multi factor authentication. An example of this would be if an employee tries to login
   to their account, they must input a code sent to their phone number to verify it is them. This means that even if an attacler gets 
   the password of an individual, there is an extra layer of security to protect the systems.
   Companies can also use tools to detect any malicious messages and block them before they reach their employees' inboxes. This
   will greatly reduce the risk of an employee clicking on any fraudulent links, therefore protecting the companies data and 
   systems.
   A final strategy that should be used is to encourage people to verify any requests through official sources. This combats 
   pretexting. If an employee or person recieves an unexpected request they should call the company that the request has been
   said to have come from. Then they will be able to verify it is an actual request or a fake one. This then greatly reduces the 
   risk of the user fulfilling the attackers requests.

  <h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

  <p class="ex1">
  <pre id="Conclusion_InText">
   Social Engineering attacks continue to rise each year as it exploits human nature rather than technical weakness.
   Methods such as phishing, smishing and pretexting remain highly effective, leading to data breaches and financial loss. That is 
   why it is very important that people and organisations must increase their awareness on the matter. Though there is no solution that 
   can completely prevent the threat, improving peoples understanding and implementing certain strategies can significantly reduce the 
   success of social engineering attacks.
